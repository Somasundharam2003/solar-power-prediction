Solar Energy Production Prediction using Machine Learning

This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict solar power generation in Berkeley, California. By analyzing how environmental variables such as temperature, humidity, sky cover, and solar noon proximity affect energy output, this notebook builds a robust predictive model using a Random Forest Regressor and hyperparameter optimization through GridSearchCV.

Project Motivation

Solar energy is one of the most promising sources of renewable energy. However, its efficiency and consistency are highly dependent on environmental conditions. Accurately forecasting energy production can:

* Optimize the operation of solar farms.
* Reduce reliance on non-renewable backup systems.
* Enhance decision-making in energy grid management.
* Contribute to the transition toward sustainable energy ecosystems.


Dataset Overview

The dataset is based on a solar energy system located in Berkeley, California, with:

* **2929 rows** and **16 features** (both numerical and categorical)
* Columns include:

  * `Average Temperature (Day)`, `Relative Humidity`, `Visibility`, `Sky Cover`
  * `Distance to Solar Noon`, `Is Daylight`, `Wind Speed`, `Power Generated` (target)
  * Time-based features: `Day`, `Month`, `Year`, `First Hour of Period`

The data shows seasonal, temporal, and environmental variation in energy output.


Feature Engineering

The following preprocessing and engineering steps were applied:

* **Missing Value Handling**: Imputed using column mean to preserve structure.
* **Categorical Encoding**: One-hot encoding for `season`, `sky cover`, `time of day`, `solar proximity`.
* **New Features**:

  * `season`: Derived from month
  * `time of day`: Derived from hour
  * `solar proximity`: Based on distance to solar noon
* **Redundant Columns Removed**: Original temporal features dropped post-transformation.
* **Standardization**: Applied to all numerical features.

## ⚙️ Model Optimization

Hyperparameter tuning was done using `GridSearchCV` with 5-fold cross-validation.

**Best Parameters:**

```python
{
  'n_estimators': 200,
  'max_depth': 20,
  'min_samples_split': 5,
  'min_samples_leaf': 2,
  'max_features': 'sqrt'
}
```

**Improved Model Results:**

* **MSE:** `9,834,850.31`
* **R² Score:** `0.9061`

## 📉 Visualizations

The notebook includes:

* Histogram of power generation (shows skewness, likely due to night-time data)
* Correlation matrix (high negative correlation with distance to solar noon)
* Scatter plots between features and output (non-linear trends)
* Line plots to show seasonal production patterns
* Before-and-after model performance plots
